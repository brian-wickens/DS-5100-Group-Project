To tests if there are a significant correlation between building age and energy 
intensity among different categories of buildings and build regression models.

Notes:
Are there other variables which we can use to make this MLR?
Check regression assumptions
If we can identify timelines for new-build standards in city or building code 
can run t-test for buildings pre/post design requirement changes.
